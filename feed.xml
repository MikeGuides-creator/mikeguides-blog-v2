<p>If you’re new here, this page will give you a quick lay of the land and a simple way to get started.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="1-what-this-blog-is-for">1. What this blog is for</h2>

<p>This blog exists to help you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Price your offers with <strong>real profit targets</strong>, not guesses</li>
  <li>Use <strong>AI as a practical tool</strong>, not a toy</li>
  <li>Make decisions with <strong>simple, clear steps</strong> instead of spreadsheets and chaos</li>
</ul>

<p>You won’t see theory for theory’s sake here. Every post is meant to be something you can use in a real business.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="2-where-to-go-first">2. Where to go first</h2>

<p>If you’re brand new to my world, here are the first places to visit:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Pricing for Profit System</strong><br />
This is the core guide that shows you how to think about pricing, profit, and simple targets.<br />
Visit: <a href="https://pricingforprofit.co">pricingforprofit.co</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>MikeGuides.co</strong><br />
This is where you’ll find my other tools and interactive guides.<br />
Visit: <a href="https://mikeguides.co">MikeGuides.co</a></p>

</ul>

<p>Read a few posts here, then go check out those two sites when you’re ready for something more structured.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="3-how-the-posts-are-organized">3. How the posts are organized</h2>

<p>Over time, you’ll see posts fall into a few loose buckets:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Pricing fundamentals</strong> – how to think about price, value, and profit</li>
  <li><strong>AI in your business</strong> – using tools like ChatGPT in a practical way</li>
  <li><strong>Behind the guides</strong> – context and walkthroughs for the tools I build</li>
</ul>

<p>For now, the blog is small and growing. As it expands, I’ll make it easier to filter and find what you need.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="4-how-to-get-the-most-out-of-this">4. How to get the most out of this</h2>

<p>Here’s a simple way to use this blog:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Pick one post that matches a problem you actually have right now.</li>
  <li>Read it once without stress.</li>
  <li>Read it again and <strong>do one small thing it suggests</strong>.</li>
  <li>Come back another day and repeat.</li>
</ol>

<p>Small, calm steps beat giant “someday” plans.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="5-whats-coming-next">5. What’s coming next</h2>

<p>In the near future, you’ll see:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A simple <strong>free resources area</strong> you can browse</li>
