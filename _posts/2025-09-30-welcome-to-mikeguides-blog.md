Welcome! 👋

This blog is about one thing: **shipping useful work** — pricing smarter, marketing faster, and executing with simple tools.

## Start here (free)
Grab a free starter to see how we work:

## What you’ll find
- **Pricing & Profit** — calculators, targets, and repeatable review cadences.
- **Marketing & Content** — frameworks, prompts, and workflows that are ready to run.
- **Execution** — checklists, templates, tiny scripts that save hours.
