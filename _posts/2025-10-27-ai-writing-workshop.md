If you've ever stared at a blank page, this is for you. **AI Writing Workshop** interviews you with quick questions, turns your answers into **tailored prompts**, and helps you draft articles, blog posts, emails, and landing pages—fast.

## What it does (in 60 seconds)
- **Interviews you** to clarify audience, angle, and outcomes  
- Generates **structured outlines** and headline options  
- Produces **drafts you can refine** (voice, length, examples)  
- Saves reusable prompts as a personal library

> Built to eliminate decision friction and get you publishing.

## How it works (simple flow)
1. Pick your goal: blog post, newsletter, product page, etc.  
2. Answer a few focused questions (audience, promise, proof).  
3. Get a **prompt pack** and **first draft** in your voice.  
4. Iterate: improve hook, add stories, adjust tone & length.

## Why it’s different
Most tools dump generic text. This workshop makes you **think clearly first**, so drafts match your audience and intent—**not** templates.

### Pro tip: speed up your next post
Keep a “Wins & Proof” doc. Each time you publish, save the best result (traffic, replies, sales). Use it in the workshop to add credibility on the next draft—your conversions will climb.
