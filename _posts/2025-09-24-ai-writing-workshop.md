If you're a solo founder or running a small service business, you already know the challenge: **consistent marketing content doesn't create itself.** The AI Writing Workshop turns “I should post something” into **a repeatable system** you can run in minutes, not hours.

## What it fixes (in plain English)
- **Blank page syndrome:** it interviews you and builds the outline for you.  
- **Inconsistent voice:** it “locks in” your tone and phrases you like.  
- **Slow drafting:** it turns your bullet points into publish-ready copy.  
- **One-and-done posts:** it repurposes drafts into email, blog, and social.

## How the Workshop works
1. **Guided Intake** — quick questions about audience, offer, proof, and CTA.  
2. **Prompt Builder** — assembles precise prompts from your answers (no guesswork).  
3. **Outline → Draft** — generates an outline, then a full draft you can tighten.  
4. **Voice Tuning** — add “voice notes” (e.g., shorter sentences, plain language, friendly but direct).  
5. **Repurpose** — produce variants: short post, email, long-form blog, headline set, CTA options.  
6. **QC Checklist** — clarity pass, one proof point, single CTA, scannable subheads.

## 20-minute loop you can run weekly
**0–3 min** — Pick one asset (blog, email, or post) and a single CTA.  
**3–6 min** — Answer the intake prompts (audience, promise, proof).  
**6–10 min** — Generate outline → first draft.  
**10–15 min** — Tighten: shorten sentences, add 1 proof line, confirm CTA.  
**15–20 min** — Repurpose to a second channel (e.g., email → LinkedIn). Ship it.

## Before → After (mini example)
**Before:** “We help businesses with marketing. Contact us to learn more.”  
**After:** “Turn one idea into a week of content. The AI Writing Workshop interviews you, builds precise prompts, and produces a clean draft in minutes—so you can publish consistently without hiring a writer.”

## Templates included (use what you need)
- **Blog post** (intro → 3 points → CTA)  
- **Newsletter** (hook → value → CTA)  
- **Landing/sales section** (promise → proof → plan → price/CTA)  
- **Case study** (problem → approach → result → takeaway)  
- **FAQ & objection handler**  
- **Short posts & headlines** (10 variations)

## Pro tips for better outputs
- Keep **one goal** per asset (one CTA).  
- Add **1 proof line** (result, testimonial, demo).  
- Save winning prompts/results into a **swipe file** for faster reuse.  
- Maintain a short **voice guide**: 3 adjectives + 3 “always do” rules.

## FAQs
**Do I need to be technical?** No. It’s a guided, step-by-step workflow.  
**Which AI does it use?** It’s model-agnostic—built around clear prompts and structure, so you can use your preferred AI tool.  
**Will it sound generic?** Not if you add voice notes and one proof point—those two inputs do most of the heavy lifting.
