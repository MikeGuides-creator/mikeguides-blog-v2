If marketing feels chaotic, run this 20-minute loop:

## 1) Pick one goal
Newsletter, product page update, or a single social post. One asset only.

## 2) Fill the Strategy Card (3 minutes)
- Audience: who is this for?
- Promise: what outcome do they want?
- Proof: what backs it up? (result, testimonial, demo)

## 3) Generate prompts (5 minutes)
Open the **AI Marketing Toolkit** and use the prompt blocks:
- Hook lines (10 options)
- Outline (intro → 3 points → CTA)
- Variation generator (turn long → short, or post → email)

## 4) Draft & tighten (8 minutes)
- Keep sentences short.
- Add one proof point.
- End with a single CTA.

## 5) Publish (4 minutes)
- Post it now. Don't over-polish.
- Save the prompt + result to your swipe file for next week.
