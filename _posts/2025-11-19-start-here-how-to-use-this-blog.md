Welcome — I’m building this blog to go along with the **Pricing for Profit System** and my **MikeGuides** tools.

If you're new here, this page will give you a quick lay of the land and a simple way to get started.

## 1. What this blog is for

This blog exists to help you:

- Price your offers with **real profit targets**, not guesses  
- Use **AI as a practical tool**, not a toy  
- Make decisions with **simple, clear steps** instead of spreadsheets and chaos  

You won’t see theory for theory’s sake here. Every post is meant to be something you can use in a real business.

## 2. Where to go first

If you’re brand new to my world, here are the first places to visit:

- **Pricing for Profit System**  
  This is the core guide that shows you how to think about pricing, profit, and simple targets.  
  Visit: [pricingforprofit.co](https://pricingforprofit.co)

- **MikeGuides.co**  
  This is where you’ll find my other tools and interactive guides.  
  Visit: [MikeGuides.co](https://mikeguides.co)

Read a few posts here, then go check out those two sites when you’re ready for something more structured.

## 3. How the posts are organized

Over time, you’ll see posts fall into a few loose buckets:

- **Pricing fundamentals** – how to think about price, value, and profit  
- **AI in your business** – using tools like ChatGPT in a practical way  
- **Behind the guides** – context and walkthroughs for the tools I build  

For now, the blog is small and growing. As it expands, I’ll make it easier to filter and find what you need.

## 4. How to get the most out of this

Here’s a simple way to use this blog:

1. Pick one post that matches a problem you actually have right now.  
2. Read it once without stress.  
3. Read it again and **do one small thing it suggests**.  
4. Come back another day and repeat.

Small, calm steps beat giant “someday” plans.

## 5. What’s coming next

In the near future, you’ll see:

- A simple **free resources area** you can browse  
- More walkthroughs of the Pricing for Profit ideas  
- Practical posts about using AI to save time and reduce chaos

Thanks for being here.  
This blog — like the rest of my work — is a work in progress, but it’s built to actually help you move forward, not just add more noise.
