Pricing doesnâ€™t have to be complicated. Use this quick flow:

1. **Know your costs.** Materials, time, overhead.
2. **Pick a target margin.** 40â€“60% is a healthy range for many service businesses.
3. **Package clearly.** 2â€“3 options max. Keep scope tight.
4. **Review quarterly.** Costs moveâ€”your prices should too.
